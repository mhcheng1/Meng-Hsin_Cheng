# Guessing Game Web App

A web application implemented using React-Django framework. 
It allows a host to create a game room and enters the inputs for the object and hints the host have in mind. Then the host is given a unique room ID with the answer stored in it. Once the game ends, the guests participating in the game can then join the room with room ID to see if they got the correct answer.
